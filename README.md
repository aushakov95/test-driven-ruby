# Ruby Project
# from [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/ruby?ref=lnav)
# and [TestFirst.org](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby)

The purpose of this project was to practice test-driven development in Ruby.
I was given 15 labs by TestFirst.org. Each lab contained a *\_spec* file, which had pre-written tests by TestFirst.org. My assignment for each lab was to pass all the given tests. As specified by The Odin Project, I was to do labs 01, 02, 03, 04, 08 and 09.
